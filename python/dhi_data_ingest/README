This program is designed to parse output files from a dairy heard improvement (DHI) source, and insert them into a database.

For python 2.7 and postgres < 2.5 compatibility, the 'dhi_data_ingest.py' file found in the 'data_ingest' directory can be run via a command line interface with the correct arguments to parse the input. Database credentials are stored in the 'config.py' file, with a template included. Running 'dhi_data_ingest.py' with the '--help' flag will give you the command line specifications. A farm id must be passed in using the -i flag, along with one or more filenames to be processed. The program will automagically identify whether the file is of the ingredient or dmi type and parse it accordingly. Verbosity levels can be set using the '-v' flag, the '--TEST' flag will run the program and output to a csv file (if no input file is specified, it will look for the included 'test_input.csv' example file).

Note that any of the details specific to the agSource data files are contained within the additional 'agsource_parser.py' file, meaning that the 'dhi_data_ingest.py' program could be extended by creating additional parsing files using approaches outlined in 'agsource_parser.py'.
