This program is designed to parse output files from the DeLaval alpro milking software, parse them, and insert them into a database.

The script is designed for compatability with python 2.7 and postgres < 2.5 compatibility, and a CLI can be accessed by running the 'milking_data_ingest.py' file. Database credentials are stored in the 'config.py' file, as shown in the included (non-valid) template. Running 'milk_data_ingest.py' with the '--help' flag will give you the command line specifications. A farm id must be passed in using the -i flag, along with one or more filenames to be processed. Verbosity levels can be set using the '-v' flag, the '--TEST' flag will run the program and output to a csv file (if no input file is specified, it will look for the included 'test_input.csv' example file).

Note that any of the details specific to the alpro software output files are contained within the additional 'alpro_parser.py' file, meaning that the 'milking_data_ingest.py' program could be extended by creating additional parsing files using approaches outlined in 'alpro_parser.py'.
